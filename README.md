# motif-mark

Motif mark takes a FASTA file with sequences of interest, and a motif file containing one motif per line (no commas), and outputs a .svg file of the motif locations within the sequences.

I know you mentioned you had some problems with the shebangs in the last assignment. If you encounter any trouble here, it's probably because I'm calling python3 in my shebang (since "python" for me loads python 2).
